This is my personal nvim config files. 

Heavily borrowed and adapted from Astronvim, but I wanted the whole config in one place, or at least moreso.

As a result,this is everything, no longer split between main config and user specific option overrides. 

I could't accomplish what I wanted to with the first way, I wanted to have more control and a faster iteration loop and more discoverability.
